## Clean Code Lessons

- **Naming Convention**: Adopt consistent and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes to improve code
  readability.
- **Comments and Documentation**: Write clear and concise comments to explain the purpose and logic behind the program's
  code and its different sections.
- **Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Avoid "bad patterns" rather than a pattern itself by avoiding repetitive line of
  codes in the program.
