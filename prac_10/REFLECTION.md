# CP1404: Reflection

CP1404 Reflection by Hexon Hartley Jimenez

## About this README

This reflection is all about my thoughts related to time estimates for practical tasks, code reviews, and overall
practical tasks.

**1. Time estimates for practicals tasks:**

- The time estimates at the start of its weekly addition were inaccurate because I seemed to have set my expectations
  unrealistically high in relation to my current skill level, only later grasping the true amount of time required for
  task completion. But as weeks went on, incorporating such estimates has enabled me to learn my own patterns and
  reflect on the way I approach future tasks. However, I've also learned that despite my efforts to provide estimations
  as accurate as possible, certain tasks can be unpredictably challenging. This dynamic plays a significant role in
  influencing my time to complete the task.

**2. My learning experience from getting reviewed and doings reviews for code reviews:**

- When doing the reviews, it helped me reflect on my coding practices, such as things I have missed out on, the
  syntax, indentations and appropriately naming variables, classes, methods and how to appropriately incorporate line
  comments and docstrings. Besides that, reviewing other's work enabled me to learn the thought process of writing their
  own version of their program. This improved my ability to articulate my thoughts when evaluating their work. When it
  comes to having my work reviewed, I've received some feedbacks from my peers that highlights on the areas that needed
  improvement. For instance, in prac05, I was suggested to use a .title to make the name title case. Being reviewed
  helped in ensuring that I  am following the programming standards that was taught for this subject.

**3. Overall thoughts on practical tasks, suggestions for improvements:**

- I think the practical tasks should have extended due dates to complete because sometimes making prediction of the
  actual time to complete some of the task could be underestimated given the nature of its complexity and
  unpredictability, also taking into consideration the person's current programming skill level and how well they have
  grasped the concept of the subject.

## Two (2) PRs with good code reviews I made from past practicals:

- Week 5, prac05: https://github.com/dona-reano/cp1404practicals/pull/2
- Week 7, prac07: https://github.com/SallySheldon/cp1404practicals/pull/4
